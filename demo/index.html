  <h1>
    react-aria-modal demo
  </h1>

  <h2>
    demo one
  </h2>
  <p>
    This modal
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      has an invisible but still screen-reader-accessible title
    </li>
    <li>
      places initial focus on the deactivation button
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div id="demo-one"></div>

  <h2>
    demo two
  </h2>
  <p>
    This modal
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      is vertically centered
    </li>
    <li>
      does not close when the underlay is clicked
    </li>
    <li>
      has a visible title (which is also used by the screen-reader)
    </li>
    <li>
      does not deliberately place focus, so the first element in the tab order receives focus
    </li>
    <li>
      has an internally scrolling region
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div id="demo-two"></div>

  <h2>
    demo three
  </h2>
  <p>
    This modal
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      is tall enough that scrolling is required to see all of its content
    </li>
    <li>
      adds a tabIndex to the dialog element itself, without outline, so the focus trap
      still works but no focus outline is initially visible
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div id="demo-three"></div>

  <h2>
    demo four
  </h2>
  <p>
    This modal's active/inactive state is controlled with the <code>active</code> prop instead of
    mounting and unmounting.
  </p>
  <div id="demo-four"></div>
